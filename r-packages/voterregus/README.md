Overview
--------

The voterregus (Voter Reg(istration) US) package provides functionality for loading information about...voter registration in the
United States.  The initial goal is to provide data on registration in states that allow party affiliation as close to the
time of the 2016 general election as data are available.  We will iterate on this initial goal to include historical data
and also data from states that do not support party affiliation.

Installation
------------

We do not have immediate plans to push the package to CRAN, so you need to install directly from GitHub.  Note that this
will install all dependencies as well.  These dependencies include the rgeos package, which can be a little tricky to
install on some platforms.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Data4Democracy/voter-fraud/r-packages/voterregus")
```

Usage
-----

Most users will just want to access the PartyRegistration data frame that is exposed by the package:
