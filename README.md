## Getting Started

### Want to Contribute?
* **"First-timers" are welcome!** Whether you're trying to learn data science, hone your coding skills, or get started collaborating over the web, we're happy to help. If you have any questions feel free to pose them on our [slack channel](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/election-transparency), or reach out to one of the team leads. If you have questions about Git and GitHub specifically, our [github-playground](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/github-playground) repo and the [#github-help](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/github-help) Slack channel are good places to start.
* **Feeling Comfortable with GitHub, and Ready to Dig In?** Check out our GitHub issues. This is our official listing of the work that we are planning to get done. As we add more issues, the maintainers will make sure to specifically tag those issues that are good for beginners with: `beginner-friendly`
* **Code Reviews:** All commits to this repository are reviewed by either a team lead or maintainer. The goal of these reviews is two-fold: We want to make sure we have a high quality product, but we also want to make sure that we all learn from one another. These reviews will allow both the submitter and the reviewer a chance to do just that.
* **This README is a Living Document:** If you see something you think should be changed feel free to edit and submit a Pull Request. Not only will this be a huge help to the group, it is also a great first PR!
* **Got an Idea for Something We Should be Working On?** You can submit an issue on our GitHub page, mention your idea on the [slack channel](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/election-transparency), or reach out to one of the project leads.
