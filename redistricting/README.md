## Home to the Redistricting Project

### Questions We Would Like to Answer

- How much do current district boundaries deviate from a fairly-drawn district? 
- What are appropriate measures of a fairly-drawn district?
 - Are certain district boundaries and/or rules better for Republicans, Democrats, Homogeneity on other measures, or heterogeneity on other measures?
- How well do current districts represent the demographics of the country?
- Related, how representative of the overall population are the current districts with respect to the weightings applied in representatives? Can we tie those two things together?
- Are there other systems that make more sense when it comes to fair and open elections?
 - For example: Proportional Representation in larger districts
