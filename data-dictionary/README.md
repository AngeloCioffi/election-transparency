The election-transparency team has been busy collecting data to work on all of our modeling and visualization projects. The listing below gives a short description as well as a link to a full data dictionary for each file. All of our data are posted on [data.world](https://data.world/data4democracy/election-transparency). You can download the raw CSVs from data.world, use their API directly, or even install the data.world [R package](https://github.com/datadotworld/data.world-r) and query the data that way.
