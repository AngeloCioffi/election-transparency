# Gather Non-Voting Data for Modeling

We need to collect non-voting related data for use in our other projects here on the `election-transparency` team. In fact, some of these data could even end up being used for other Data4Democracy projects! Thus far we are focusing on collecting data from the 5-year American Community Survey data for the most recent year (2015). However, we are open to collecting both historical data as well as data from other sources, as long as you think it will help to better our understanding of elections in the United States!

## I want the data... where do I find it?

Like our other projects we are storing data on [data.world](https://data.world/data4democracy/election-transparency). Currently, we have posted the following supplementary datasets:

1. [demo_ACS2015.csv](https://data.world/data4democracy/election-transparency/file/demo_ACS2015.csv)

## What have we collected so far?

- American Community Survey (2015 5-year)
 - Age by Race (County)

## What else do we have on our list?

- American Community Survey (2015 5-year)
 - Occupations (County)
 - Education (County)

## How can I help collect data?

If you would like to help us out, and you feel comfortable using the Census API (or another method for other data), just let us know that you are going to collect the data and go for it! Feel free to fork this repo and start working from the code provided, or write your own code (we just ask that you post any code you use to clean the data so we have a record). 

If you would like to help, but feel like you need some direction, let us know on the [Slack channel](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/election-transparency) or DM @chris_dick.

## I have an idea of data we should collect: What should I do?

**Please let us know!** If you have time to start collecting the data, just give us a heads up and we will add it to the list of data we are collecting and also assign you to the task. If you don't have time to collect the data, that is totally fine, we still want to know about it. Contact @chrisdick14 (on GitHub) or @chris_dick on Slack. He will add the dataset and find someone to start collecting the data.
